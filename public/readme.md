## Javascript API Documentation

API for Phone is accessible in global object `window.IPub.Forms.Phone`.

### Loading

Server-side part of Phone form element is element with custom data attribute `data-ipub-forms-phone`. This element can be initialized with method `init()`.

```js
var phone = new IPub.Forms.Phone($('[data-ipub-forms-phone]'));
    phone.init();
```

But there is shortcut implemented as jQuery plugin:

```js
$('[data-ipub-forms-phone]').ipubFormsPhone();
```

You can chain other jQuery methods after this as usual. If you try to initialize one Phone twice, it will fail silently (second initialization won't proceed).

Finally you can initialize phone field on the page by calling:

```js
IPub.Forms.Phone.load();
```

This plugin is initialized automatically, so you don't need to add another calls, you just need to inject JS file into your page.
